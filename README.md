# Instagram Posts Likes Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the number of likes an Instagram post will receive based on various features. We use machine learning models, specifically XGBoost regression and classification, to make these predictions.

## Features
- Predictive modeling of Instagram post engagement
- Image analysis to determine visual features that impact likes
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/scottie1013/Instagram-Posts-Likes-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Instagram-Posts-Likes-Prediction
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
[Provide instructions on how to run your main scripts or notebooks]

## Data
[Describe your dataset, where it comes from, and any preprocessing steps]

## Models
We use two main models in this project:
1. XGBoost Regression: For predicting the exact number of likes
2. XGBoost Classification: For categorizing posts into low, medium, and high engagement
